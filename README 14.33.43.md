 You must make an android project with a solution about the topic, demonstrating that you had
hands on experience on the topic. The ambition level is prototype level – not a perfect project. The
code must be well made, so include comments and proper formatting. A few topics are more
theoretical, and thus may get exemption from handing in code, while other projects may be less
interesting to describe textually, thus requiring more code effort.
